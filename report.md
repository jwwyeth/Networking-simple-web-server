For this assignment we were tasked with coding a web server that holds html files and a client browser who can ask the server for the html files.  If the files do not exists then a 404 error is given.  In the web_server.py file in the main function it can be observed that multithreading is possible each thread is then carried to the handler function to be dealt with.  In the handler function the message is received as the variable request_msg.  We then take this variable and decode it, split it, and slice it [1:] in order to parse the path we need. After that, we open the path, read the file, and then send it to client encoded after giving the 200 OK status. If the path does not exists, we give a 404 error and throw up not_found.html.

On the client side of the assignment in client_browser.py, based off of the input given we parse the information into server_hostname, server_ip, server_port, and file_name. Once the information has been parsed we make a GET request to the web server using file_name and server_hostname.  When the client receives  the request back from the server we while loop it and append it through a list to ensure that we get all the information.  Afterwards, we join the list back together, reading it as bytes.  After decoding it we print out our request from the server.

As can be observed in both .pngs files the program is being ran on the terminal on the left side and wireshark is tracing the interaction with all outputs being as expected.  It should also be noted for both .png files that the selected HTTP protocol shows the 200 OK status and the contents of the transmission (hello_world.html) can be seen on the far right in the bottom lower box.  This shows that the communication was a success.
